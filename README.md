# Space-Invaders
A modern Python remake of the classic 90s Space Invaders. Control your ship, dodge enemy fire, and destroy alien waves as difficulty increases. Features smooth gameplay, multiple levels, lives, and high score tracking — a nostalgic arcade experience built with Turtle Graphics.
This project is a modern recreation of the classic 90s arcade game “Space Invaders”, built entirely using Python’s Turtle Graphics. It brings back the nostalgic gameplay of shooting waves of alien invaders, but with a refreshed, minimal, and colorful design suited for modern systems.

In this version, the player controls a triangular spaceship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen and shoots projectiles at descending enemies. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases — enemies move faster, shoot back, and appear in larger numbers. Players must survive by avoiding incoming fire while earning points for every alien destroyed.

The game includes essential retro mechanics such as:

Multiple levels with gradually increasing speed and difficulty.

Lives system, where the player gets limited chances to survive enemy contact.

High score tracking, saved locally in a text file (highscore.txt), so players can challenge their own records over multiple sessions.

Smooth HUD display showing score, lives, level, and controls.

Built with simplicity in mind, this program uses only the turtle, math, time, os, and random modules — making it lightweight and easy to run on any Python installation without external dependencies. Despite its simple graphics, the project effectively demonstrates collision detection, object-oriented coordination, and basic game physics — perfect for students or hobbyists learning the fundamentals of game development in Python.

Overall, this project recreates the thrill of the original Space Invaders experience while serving as a fun, educational example of building a complete arcade-style game from scratch in Python.
